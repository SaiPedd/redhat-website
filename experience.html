                <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Learning the importance and impact of open source software.</li>
                <li><strong>Ideology:</strong> Appreciating Red Hat's belief in the power of sharing ideas to benefit humanity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pros & Cons</h2>

                </div>
                <div class="cons">
                    <h3>Cons</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Short Program Duration:</strong> The limited duration of the program felt insufficient to fully immerse in and absorb all the learning opportunities available.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Engaging Tasks:</strong> While there were many meetings, the program lacked hands-on tasks and projects, making it challenging to feel actively involved and productive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Intense Schedule:</strong> The back-to-back meetings, often without breaks, were overwhelming and didn’t allow enough time to process the information or apply the knowledge gained.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interest-Specific Learning:</strong> The program would benefit from allowing interns to concentrate on specific areas of interest, rather than a generalized approach for the entire group.</li>
                        <li><strong>Need for More Assignments:</strong> A more structured schedule with well-planned assignments and projects would enhance the learning experience and provide practical application opportunities.</li>
                    </ul>
